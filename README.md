# Map_The_Stats_Group

Summary : Map The Stats is an application allowing users to select a certain geographic location to gather statistical information about the area. Users will select a location using the google maps API and then the information will be pre-populated by various other API's including population data, crime statistics, labor statistics and more. All of this will be included in the MVP. 

P1/2 - Future goals would be being able to compare locations and having saved settings for users if they choose so they can stay up to date on information.
